# Dice Roller
### Overview 
This is a project that is meant to show the server-client relationship by having this as the static site where the user can interact with it and roll a die and then all the extra logic is handled by the server site where then it completes any necessary functions before sending back the result to the client site. 

### How to Run This Application
If you want to run this project locally, you can clone this repository to your computer.

Then, to start the web application on a local development server, run the command: npm start This will compile the React app and then open it in a default browser usually at http://localhost:3000 If there are issues with this, you may have set that specific port for something else on your machine so you may need to research how to change that so it can run on your browser locally and view any changes before committing them to GitHub.

If you do get to a point where you would like to commit any changes, then you can use a terminal or the separate source control center in VSCode to view the changed files and then write a commit message before clicking on the dropdown menu to commit and push the changes.

If you have this hosted on Azure through GitHub, then you can check its build progress through GitHub actions and then once it’s built successfully, then you can view the Azure site through the link for the static site. If you want to interact with the server component, you will follow similar steps to clone it and make any necessary changes and then you will also need to run it. However, you can also just check out the links below too if you just want to view and interact with the application.
